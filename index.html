                    Happy Valentines Day! This Valentines Day I wasn't able to see my girlfriend, so I made a little chrome extension for her!
                    <br><br>
                    The extension replaces the newtab page of the Chrome browser. 
                    Instead of the default page, it displays a page with a random dog (she loves dogs!) as the background and a random message (which is personalized and preset).
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="chromplimentor/index.html">Click here</a> to see what replaces the newtab page! You can refresh to re-randomize the text and background picture!

                    </ul>
                    Challenges and things I learned:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Making a GET request to the API for the dog pictures
                        <ul>
                          <li>With Javascript, you have to deal with a "Promise" class which confused me at first, but eventually I got it to work</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    P.S. Coming up with the punny name for this app made me very happy!

                    This game was made using the Unity game engine along with C#. It is a single player, FPS (first person shooter) game.
                    <br><br>
                    It features AI enemies that patrol, chase, and attack the player, a spawner that randomly spawns enemies, player shooting and reload animations, an informative HUD (heads up display), a main and pause menu system, a final boss, and some game sounds recorded by yours truly!
                    <br><br>
                    I had a really rough time starting the project, but I definately learned a lot over the course of creating this project! I had a lot of fun creating this game and I hope you have fun playing it too!

                    <ul>
                      <li>Unity game engine</li>
                      <li>C#</li>
                    </ul>
                    Challenges and things I learned:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Creating a player controller that felt smooth to control and a HUD to keep the player informed
                        <ul>
                          <li>this includes making animations for shooting and reloading the gun, which I think turned out to look really cool</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Creating AI enemies that didn't bug out and crash the game
                        <ul>
                          <li>there were an unbelieveable number of bugs related to the enemies</li>
                          <li>one of the buggiest was probably was the enemies' pathfinding and interacting with the map</li>
                          <li>another big challenge of this was creating enemies that shoot projectiles at the player, and making the projectiles behave properly as well</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Creating a spawner that spawns those enemies onto the map in random locations</li>
                      <li>Creating a main and pause menu that functioned properly (this was also surprisingly really prone to bugs)</li>
                      <li>Creating a map where the game could take place</li>
                      <li>Adding quality of life features to help the player know what they need to do next</li>
                      <li>Finding art that fit what I envisioned</li>
